My strategic basic research falls within genetics, genomics, and plant pathology. I research plant-pathogen interaction, focusing on Brassica napus-Leptosphaeria maculans and B. napus-Verticillium longisporum pathosystems. My work involves using plant pathology knowledge and methodology to recognise and diagnose fungal pathogens on plant material in the field and laboratory and applying bioinformatics and computational biology to develop, analyse and visualise genomic data.
This profile provides Basic to Pro Python and R codes with plant genetics, genomics and agricultural-based examples.
