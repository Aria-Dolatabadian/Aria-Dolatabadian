My research focuses on the intersection of genetics, genomics, and plant pathology, specifically emphasising plant-pathogen interactions within the *Brassica napus-Leptosphaeria maculans* and *B. napus-Verticillium longisporum* pathosystems. I employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining my expertise in plant pathology with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology techniques.
One of my work's key aspects involves identifying and diagnosing fungal pathogens affecting plant materials in field and laboratory settings. By leveraging my extensive plant pathology knowledge and cutting-edge molecular techniques, I contribute to developing, analysing, and visualising genomic data related to these plant-pathogen interactions.
This profile provides Basic to Pro Python, R and SAS codes with plant genetics, genomics and agricultural-based examples and Statistical, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning programming.
