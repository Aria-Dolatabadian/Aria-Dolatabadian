My research focuses on the intersection of genetics, genomics, and plant pathology, with a specific emphasis on plant-pathogen interactions within the Brassica napus-Leptosphaeria maculans and B. napus-Verticillium longisporum pathosystems. I employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining my expertise in plant pathology with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology techniques.
One of my work's key aspects involves identifying and diagnosing fungal pathogens affecting plant materials in both field and laboratory settings. By leveraging my extensive knowledge of plant pathology and employing cutting-edge molecular techniques, I contribute to developing, analysing, and visualising genomic data related to these plant-pathogen interactions.
This profile provides Basic to Pro Python and R codes with plant genetics, genomics and agricultural-based examples and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning programming.
